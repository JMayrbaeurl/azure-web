Windows Azure Support for Java Web applications
===============================================

This project provides supporting classes for Java Web applications that want to use [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/) services. 
Currently only an experimental version of [Windows Azure Active Directory/Access Control](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/identity/)
 integration is available. 
The source code was originally contained in the **Windows Azure Toolkit for Eclipse with Java** (see Utils/ACSFilter) and 
was extracted and mavenized to make it possible to use this kind of functionality with 'standard' Java web applications.

Please see the orginal documentation from the 
[Windows Azure Toolkit for Eclipse with Java](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/WindowsAzureToolkitForEclipseWithJava) 
in the folder 'documentation'
